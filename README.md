# [TailwindCSS][tw] Demo Application

## Description

This is a purposely small and ugly, but functional, application that we can practice and demonstrate various
patterns of using [TailwindCSS][tw]'s design language to improve the speed and consistency of our application
development process.

## Branches:

The intent is to walk through the styling of the application during a live demonstration, but if you would
prefer to just skip to the good bits - each of these branches builds on the one above it

- **[main](https://github.com/code-chimp/ng-tailwind-demo)**: basic unstyled working application
- **[tw-default](https://github.com/code-chimp/ng-tailwind-demo/tree/tw-default)**: following Tailwind's suggested usage guidelines
- **[tw-vanish](https://github.com/code-chimp/ng-tailwind-demo/tree/tw-vanish)**: proposed pattern to minimize the "class-itis" of vanilla TailwindCSS
- **[bonus](https://github.com/code-chimp/ng-tailwind-demo/tree/bonus)**: touch on [custom theming][uitheme]
